This is a human resources system I did for my graduation project. It is all in spanish. 
One of the observations I got was to make evaluations more flexible, so that user could choose if they want it by semester, annually, etc.
In order to do this, procedures would need to be modified for the reports and probably add another module for supervisors.
Anyways, I dont have the time to work it. Feel free to make any changes or use as an Idea for your project!
